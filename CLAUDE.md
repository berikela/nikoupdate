# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple static HTML website with Georgian language content. The project consists of:

- `index.html` - Main page containing a comparison table of football players (Messi, Ronaldo, Pele) with statistics including goals, assists, and World Cup wins
- `secon.html` - Secondary page with Georgian text ("ეს არის მეორე გვერდი" - "This is the second page")
- `images/` - Directory containing image assets including screenshots and an India image

## Architecture

This is a basic static website with no build process, frameworks, or dependencies. The HTML files are standalone and can be opened directly in a web browser.

## Development

Since this is a static HTML project:

- No build commands are needed
- No package manager or dependencies
- Files can be edited directly and viewed in a browser
- The project uses Georgian language content and appears to be focused on football/soccer player statistics

## Notes
